            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> Some general cauſes of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Sin of Drunkenneſſe recited.</head>
                     <p>THe Cauſes of this notorious Sin againſt God, the Church, the Commonwealth, a Mans private Family and his own Perſon, may be divers. Some of which, I ſhall firſt in general briefly touch, and then more fully proceed to that grand one, Drinking of Healths: which not ſo much diſpoſes to Exceſſe, but by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence impoſes that Sin on men.</p>
                     <p>The firſt general occaſion hereof is, in truth, none other than the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of all tranſgreſſions againſt God, the indulgence men naturally uſe towards their Senſes. And it being
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:153333:61"/> neceſſary and laudable both, for Men, by Eating and Drinking to repair the daily decays of Nature in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; to incline them to which, God hath wiſely placed a delight in thoſe Actions tending to that end: Blind Man, not conſidering the excellent end appointed by God, by only find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pleaſure in ſatisfying his juſt Appetites, and gratifying his Palate, knoweth no mean, and admitteth no rule, but his unruly Senſes, which betray him to infinite Imprudencies and Exorbitancies, of which this of exceſſive drinking is not the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>But as to follow our Senſes brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is no ſmall cauſe of this evil; ſo may I ſay moſt truly, Not to follow our Senſes is a ſecond, and more ſhameful cauſe of Intemperance. For, though God hath indeed placed in Man a ſtrong deſire after thoſe things
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:153333:62"/> which are neceſſary for the due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſuch particular Creatures, and the whole Kinde in general: So hath he, by his ſingular Wiſdom and Goodneſſe, ſet a bound to the ſame; which men of Reaſon eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſhould not eaſily paſſe; and, as it were gaged them, ſo as men do Veſſels, that it may be known eaſily, what is their proper and convenient Contents; which exceeding, they may know they offend. Theſe Limits preſcribed thus by Nature, are a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Satiety, which every Man feels in himſelf in Eating and Drinking; ſo that upon ſuch ſufficiency, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſure and delight which puſh Men on to take a competency, ceaſe, that being attained; and a certain op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and renitency is found in Men to that, which, need requiring, they were eager after. Hence ſure it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:153333:62"/> proceeded, that ſome of the Antient Philoſophers deſcribed Virtue and Happineſſe too, in this World, to be a following of Natures dictates and ducture, and that with a great deal of Truth. For if Men would be but ſo well adviſed, eſpecially in Eating and Drinking, as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what they feel in them-ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> a quietation of Appetite and Saturity; and would not, contrary to the dictates of Senſe it ſelf, even againſt Pleaſure, take more than is uſeful, there would be but few Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons or Drunkards in the World, to what are found now adays. But alas! by I know not, or will not ſay what violences Men at firſt offer to Nature it ſelf, and frequentation of unnatural Acts, what was at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by us, becomes in time tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, then acceptable, then deſirable,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:153333:63"/> and at laſt ſo pleaſurable, that it is a more difficult thing to reſiſt that monſtrous Appetite, than it was to bring a mans ſelf to comply with it. For what will not cuſtom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance do in time? And therefore (as is before obſerved) no Apology of neceſſity, under which a Man may have by theſe means brought himſelf, can here take place, becauſe he was the unjuſt Author of ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to himſelf; but either reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon what an unnatural change he hath made in himſelf, he is bound by retrograde Mortifications to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf firſt Superfluities, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of Nature: and then, according to the old and holy rule of Chriſtian Religion, deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſome things that are in themſelves lawful, as well to revenge upon himſelf the abuſe of lawful things,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:153333:63"/> as to reduce Nature to its priſtine ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and mediocrity.</p>
                     <p>A third cauſe of this Diſorder, I make diſorderly company: For Vice, of what nature ſoever it be, is no better than a certain Itch of the Soul, which is catch'd by intimate conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Shew me (ſaith the forein Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, now almoſt endenized) what a mans companion is, I will eaſily tell you what he himſelf is: For thus ſpeaks the holy Pſalmiſt of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons, <hi>Pſal. 69. 5. They encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage themſelves in evil.</hi> And it being in the nature of moſt men to appear excellent in whatever they undertake, it is lookt on as a piece of noble e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, to be chief in ſinning, and exceed in the faculty of Drinking too. But the Apoſtle tells us with what a foul miſtake, being ſuch as glory in their ſhame: <hi>Phil. 3. 19. Come ye</hi> (ſay
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:153333:64"/> theſe Good-fellows, as they would be eſteemed even while they are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly evil) <hi>I will fetch Wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant:</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> aptly deſcribes them.</p>
                     <p>A fourth cauſe of Drunkenneſſe I make examples of greater Men had in repute for Riches, or Power, or place of credit, who though they perhaps converſe not with others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them ill inclined, yet ſhew themſelves as Lights (though as out of a dark and black Lanthorn) to others to imitate. It is in faſhion, great Men do ſo; and therefore the obſcure and mean perſon thinks it is for his credit to be Great, at any rate, and commonly with a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry event to his expectation, acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring deteſtation and contempt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:153333:64"/> of eſteem: Folly, Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, are the conſequents of ſuch imitations: but they, who by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch evil Examples, do as much as in them lies, dub with a badge of Honor ſuch Infamous Vices, muſt needs fall under a double Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as ſhall be ſhewn here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p>And fifthly, as Idleneſſe and Slothfulneſſe: A man having no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Science to engage him in, no Art Liberal or Mechanical to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himſelf about, or vilely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting theſe, expoſes himſelf to all manner of temptations, ſo eſpecially to Drinking, to paſſe away the time. And perhaps hence it proceeds, that Perſons of good Family, Birth and Fortune, not bending their minds and ſpending their precious hours in laudable Exerciſe, degenerate ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:153333:65"/> into this Ignoble Vice, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Examples to others in the ſame, who ſhould be patterns of Honour and Virtue to them.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The not putting the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Statutes in execution againſt Drunkenneſſe, hath given preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to many to offend boldly herein. When Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gave aſſiſtance to the diſtreſſed <hi>Netherlands,</hi> theſe Succours ſoon learn'd the Art, and catched the Diſeaſe of Drinking, rife in thoſe Countries, and tranſported the ſame ſoon after into <hi>England;</hi> where it ſo far prevailed, that in the fourth of King <hi>James</hi> it was judged neceſſary, a Law, with ſevere Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhould be made to redreſſe that ſpreading miſchief. But when, what the baſer ſort only, (as common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) at firſt offended in, Men of Eſtates and Faſhion afterward
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:153333:65"/> were guilty of, the wholeſome Laws ſoon became but as ſpiders webs, and lie ſtill languiſhing, craving, as it were, new vigor and enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: anſwerable to what we read, Great Defenders of Virtue, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to this hateful Vice, have ſignally ſhewed when it became common and contumacious, reſiſting and deſpiſing ordinary Remedies. And the Reverend <hi>Spotwood,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland,</hi> tells us, That about the year 970. <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> Son of <hi>Keneth</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> made a Law, by which it ſhould be death to be Drunk. Which Law, if it were in force in <hi>England</hi> at this day, it might for a time make greater ſlaughter than the greateſt Enemies to Drunkenneſſe could be content to ſee; yet, in a ſhort time, it may be ſuppoſed to prevent more Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:153333:66"/> than ſuch impunity as now is allowed. For ſeeing, and with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror lamenting, the many and foul Murders committed in Drunken Meetings, I have been inclin'd to believe, That God, beholding the abounding of this Vice, and the little regard to execute deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon ſuch Offenders, takes the puniſhment of it into his own hands, and lets theſe mad Beaſts looſe, to tear one another to pieces, and kill one another by frequent Aſſaſſinations; and ſuffers an eaſie way to be open for the Murderers to eſcape: Notwithſtanding what the Scripture adviſes to the contrary, <hi>Prov. 28. 17. A man that doth violence to the blood of any perſon, ſhall flee to the pit, let no man ſtay him.</hi> Which Rule admits only of this Exception that we know, <hi>viz.</hi> When it is offered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:153333:66"/> and meerly caſually, or upon extreme neceſſity of ſaving our own Lives; which neceſſities we muſt not bring upon our ſelves by becoming firſt Aſſailants. But when the beſt account and plea made for offering violence to the blood of a Man, ſhall be, that he was Drunk, or at leaſt had firſt offered violence to his own Reaſon by Wine, Ale or Brandy; to accept this for Innocency, which adds guilt to guilt, is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage both Murderers and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, by a Clemency which will certainly end in Fury, againſt that Land where ſuch gentleneſſe ſhall be in uſe, if not againſt the perſon ſo pittiful. It ſeems to me more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and juſt a great deal, that the frequent uſers of Brandy (that pernicious Spirit to the Bodies, Brains and Souls of men) ſhould be brought
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:153333:67"/> under the Common Law, againſt ſuch as have to do with Familiar Spirits, and ſuffer the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For Brandy is a Spirit, we all know, and they who abuſe it (as now adays it is upon no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) make it an Evil and Familiar Spirit both; and are in this reſpect more blameable than they who confederate with the Devil: For the Devil was evil, and ſo were his petty Imps, before Men had to do with them; but Brandy, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed, is made wicked and miſchievous by him that correſponds thus with it. How evil then muſt needs that Soul be that ſo accuſtoms it ſelf to it, that he is not ſenſible of the evil it brings along with it; nor perceives how it waſts and preys upon the Natural and Vital Spirits? <hi>This ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is an iniquity</hi> (if any) <hi>to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153333:67"/> by the Judges,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap. 31. For it is a fire that conſumeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> But though I preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch juſt and apparent grounds, to determine what ſuch a monſtrous and ſtill growing cuſtom deſerves, I preſume not to determine without better Authority, and counſel how to give it its deſerts, but leave it to the ſeverer laſhes of others; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Scorpions it carries with it in its own tail.</p>

                     <p>OUt of the ſtore of Cauſes, or at leaſt occaſions of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, I have thought requiſite to ſingle that of Drinking Healths, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo common and familiar to all ſorts of Perſons, and ſo generally tending to ſuch an evil Event, that all endeavors of curing this Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Diſeaſe of Drunkenneſſe, muſt needs prove vain and ineffectual, this remaining in its acquired re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and force; which that it may, we finde great Wits, great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, yea Grave too, not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153333:68"/> to defend and ſupport this Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our Age, which we judge more fit to be daſhed againſt the Stones: What hurt is in it, ſay ſome, moderately uſed? What Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, ſay others Phanatically ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, for once? Do not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt (ſay others) dignifie it? Do not the Graveſt grace and juſtifie it? Is it not a good Character, divers times, to teſtifie our affection and honour, and obſequiouſneſſe to our Friends, to our Betters, to our Governours, eſpecially our Supream? And there are not wanting ſome who can fetch an Argument from the Church and Religion, which yet I am aſhamed to ſet forth at length after the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and uſers of it. This, and much more is alledged, hereafter to be conſidered more directly. Here it may ſuffice in general, to render
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:153333:69"/> the trueſt reaſons of this to be mens Fanſies, and Appetites irregular; and laſtly, that which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> once confeſſed to be Frailty in him, <hi>viz. Plus valebat in me inolitum deterius quam inſolitum melius, i. e.</hi> An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed evil more prevailed with me, than an unaccuſtomed good: as will appear by theſe following reaſons againſt it.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, I argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it from the Heatheniſh, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, yea Idolatrous original of Healths, invented and intended for a fit Worſhip of falſe Gods and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſuppoſed to be the Souls of ſome great Hero's departed this Life, whom they ſo remembred: but with this extenuating Circumſtance, That this they did chiefly, if not only, on Feſtival days appointed to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; but the Cuſtom with us is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:153333:69"/> much worſe, for there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that do this every day, and ſcarce ever to omit it, where two or three Companions meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and commonly they joined eating to them, drinking to them, and feaſting at their Tombs. They ſuppoſed that they were Deified, and thereupon ſo honored them. We drink in remembrance of them whom we know to be alive, as if we would Deifie them: For all Worſhip given unto ſuch as are at that diſtance, that they cannot receive nor perceive the ſame done unto them, doth imply ſomewhat in him more than of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane order. And yet it miſſed but a little, but ſuch jolly compotations had prevailed in the Church among the devouter and ignoranter Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who began to do the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Martyrs for the Faith, by
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:153333:70"/> Feaſting at their Tombs, till the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance of ſome Holy Biſhops ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ill conſequence of it, timely oppoſed and ſuppreſſed the ſame. But becauſe the Heathens, who had a mind to be merry and religious at the ſame time, could not preſently go to the Sepulchres of the deceaſed, there to carowz, they brought the Ceremony home to their own Houſes, and there performed the ſame divers times in memory of them, as was pretended, though in all probability, this was commonly done more for their own Bellies ſake, than their admired Friends: which is the caſe of Drinkers of Healths at this day prompted to it rather from their Luſts than Loyalty ſo much pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yet this of honoring the dead was anciently the occaſion of <hi>Grace-Cups,</hi> as at this day they are called,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:153333:70"/> though really Graceleſſe. For as <hi>Lampridius</hi> writes in the Life of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Severus: Cum Amicos Militares babuiſſet, ut uſum</hi> Trajani, <hi>&amp;c. When he had his Friends of his Army about him, to keep up, in ſome degree, the cuſtom of</hi> Trajan (that Warlike Emperor, but notable Soaker, as it ſhould ſeem) <hi>who was wont, after the ſecond Courſe, at Meals, to drink five Glaſſes; he offered but one to his Friends, to the honor of</hi> Alexander the Great, <hi>and that a ſmall one; unleſſe any (as he might) demanded a bigger.</hi> The gods of the Heathen therefore, having been known to be Good-Fellows while they lived; they may poſſibly be eſteemed to retain that humor in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other World, and approve ſuch courſes: but to uſe any ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as an honor either to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or Dead, ſavors of profaneneſſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:153333:71"/> with us. And beſides this, there may be another reaſon for thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to drink freely after Meals, which will not hold with us; as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably of an Opinion that it was not ſo healthful to themſelves, to drink within their Meal, which ſome, not unskilful in Phyſick this day main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, notwithſtanding the Rhiming-School of <hi>Salerne</hi> writes otherwiſe, ſaying,</p>
                     <q>Inter prandendum tibi ſaepe parumque bibendum.</q>
                     <p>And the late Hiſtory of <hi>Ludolphus</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> or the <hi>Habbeſines,</hi> tells us, That theſe are wont to defer Drink altogether till the ending of their Meals, and then Drink what is ſufficient for all; alledging this for a reaſon of their ſo doing, <hi>That we muſt plant before we water:</hi> But mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:153333:71"/> vain Wits are willing to miſtake, and believe, the Antient Gallants of Old drank both as heartily in their Meals, and afterwards, as they do now adays: or that they drank the Healths of Perſons preſent, as the faſhion now is; or of the Living, as if they were dead, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their opinion, would be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and abuſive. For <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>Tuſculane</hi> Queſtions, ſaith of the <hi>Greeks: Graeci in Conviviis ſolent nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare cui poculum tradituri: The</hi> Greeks <hi>in their Banquettings were wont to name the Perſon to whom they were to deliver the Cup:</hi> implying firſt, That this was only the practice of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that ordinarily, they did only name the perſon they next drank to, without the Ceremony of an Health, Which hath been an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial Cuſtom amongſt us, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:153333:72"/> other Nations very innocent, until depraved by Modern Additions.</p>
                     <p>2. But a ſecond Evil is yet more apparent amongſt us, in Drinking of Healths; and that is, the ſpoiling a Man of his native Liberty, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his own Actions, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the uſe of his Reaſon and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes both. So that hereby is a double violence offered againſt a Man, as he is a Man indued and governed by Reaſon: The firſt is outward, in taking away his Reaſon before he drinks, denying him the liberty to judge what is fit for him to drink: but the Drunken Dictator of miſ-rule comes to him with his Glaſſe or Cup in his hand, his Sword many times by his ſide, and a great Name, and ſometimes a baſe name in his mouth, and offers, obliges, obtrudes, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the civil, modeſt, and moderate
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:153333:72"/> perſon that would willingly, if he might be permitted, be in health ſtill, and enjoy himſelf as becometh a man of reaſon, but it will hardly be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him; and there is that they call a Moral Neceſſity upon him to do as is required of him, by a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny greater than that of Princes in a Commonwealth, laying grievous Taxes, and commanding unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things at their Subjects hands. For though poſſibly they hereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the meaſures of Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, they do not uſurp a Power which belongs not to them, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe it. But theſe Princes tax whom they pleaſe, and what they pleaſe, and will exact it of them or they ſhall ſuffer for it, not as Princes in their execution of Laws, ſpeak what the Law in ſuch caſes does provide, but the Martial Law of theſe Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:153333:73"/> Hachſters, or Hectors. And ſo again having made this Invaſion upon the Ingenuous freedom of a man, they commit the ſpoiling of his inward Reaſon to the mercileſſe Wine or Ale, which generally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. They will tell you, perhaps, They ſcorn to force any body to Drink: and with ſome, this I deny not to be true, ſuch I mean, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſo perfect in this trade, make a conſcience of taking Apprentices to be bound to them: yet the very nature and end of Healths import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an obligation to accept it, and fear of offending the propounder, and diſobliging the Perſon for whoſe ſake it is offered, carries with it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the force, though not the form of Conſtraint, upon which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes uncivil, as well as unjuſt, to the ſober and ingenuous Perſon.</p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:153333:73"/>
                     <p>3. But I may well make theſe, and worſe events than theſe lightly touched, a third diſtinct Reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Healths: The barbarous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, and tragical Effects ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently concluding theſe Villanous Practices, Fightings, Woundings, and Murderings: For though Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſimple too much diſpoſes men to unnatural Violences of this ſort, yet this Drinking of Healths much more is the cauſe of Bloodſhed, or Miſchief, very near akin to it. For into the ſame Dilemma, or deſperate Snare, do they bring civiler Perſons than themſelves, into which an arch Fellow of the rebellious Houſes of Parliament boaſted once, they had brought that Bleſſed King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, by their moſt unjuſt Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Peace, offered as a due ground of a Treaty: <hi>If he grants
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:153333:74"/> our demands</hi> (ſays he) <hi>he undoes himſelf; If he does not grant them, we will undo him.</hi> So theſe tyrannical Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founders treat their Companions in impoſing Healths, knowing very well, that they who Drink what they offer, receiving the ſame, undo themſelves; and if they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, then will they undo them by wicked force. And that theſe baſe unchriſtian, ungentile prancks are no untruths framed by <hi>me,</hi> innumerable inſtances are given us in Taverns and out of Taverns alſo: But I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtance in that committed upon a <hi>Suffolk</hi> Gentleman, the only hopes of a flouriſhing Family: who at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> Aſſizes laſt Summer, 1684. hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before Drunk to ſufficiency, had, (as I am credibly informed) ſix Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Wine bearing the Titles of ſo many Healths, ſet before him by a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:153333:74"/> more unruly Spirit, obliging him by wonted adjurations to drink them all off: which the other refuſing, he took an occaſion to quarrel with him to that degree, as unexpectedly to ſtab him, ſo as he fell down, preſently dying: the Author of this Tragedy ſuffering condign puniſhment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law: which courſe of Law ſeverely executed, would more than one way clear this Nation, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under more guilt of Blood than any I can hear of in Chriſtendom. For what is the reaſon ſo many have been of late ſo baſely murdered, but a fair proſpect before them of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hands of Juſtice? And what is the reaſon that ſo many have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuffered that death which they deſerved, but the ſame hopes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, without ſucceſſe? So that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Clemency herein, ends in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:153333:75"/> greateſt tyranny and cruelty: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Divine Saying of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> Prov. 12. 20. <hi>The tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the wicked are cruel.</hi> Not ſo much underſtood (as commonly) of the hard-heartedneſſe of ungodly men, who would be thought gentle and mild, when really they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt: but in that ſenſe which <hi>Druſius</hi> in his Obſervations interprets them, agreeably to the Jewiſh Expoſitors; <hi>viz.</hi> Sparing or forbearing the due execution of Juſtice on heinous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, is a cruelty to ſuch as are Innocent, or have loſt their Goods or Lives by the hands of Wicked men; and not only to them is this a cruelty, but to their near Relations too: and not only to theſe, but to ſuch as not as yet are brought under ſuch Violencies, upon ſuch eaſie terms paſſed over; perhaps no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:153333:75"/> than this, That the Offender was in Drink, allowing one Sin to juſtifie another, and abſolve the Malefactor: like to that bold Fellow in <hi>Seneca, Epiſt. 83. Tillius Cimber,</hi> who being one of them that in the Senate mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> when this was objected to him, being a great Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, he with a bold face replyed: <hi>Ego quemquam feram, qui vinum non poſſum: Should I bear with any man, who cannot bear Wine?</hi> And he that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth this for a tolerable reaſon of ſuch Wickedneſſes, may as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at men for the Phanatical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they have drunk in, who may alledge for Murderings and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt Princes, their Zeal for Religion putting them upon it; for had they been of a ſober Religion, they would never have meditated or contrived ſo notorious an act.</p>

                     <p>4. And the conſideration of this puts me upon a Fourth reaſon againſt Healths, quite contradicting what vain perſons pretend, loving in truth more their Palates and Bellies, than their King or Country. For they ſay, It is an Honor done to the Kings Majeſty, a Teſtimony of their Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Loyalty, and a Well-wiſhing to the good ſucceſſe of their Friends, and the proſperity of the Nation. Very good hitherto, if this were all; but, What advantage, I pray, is it to King, Church, or Country, to have theſe empty Fumes and glorious Oſtentations of ſuch pretended good affection, and at the ſame time by the frequent abuſes and exceſſes under ſuch colourable Proclamations, to pull down real damage and judgment upon all theſe? I will only demand this one thing of ſuch Zealots as theſe, thus advancing the Perſons, or
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:153333:76"/> Cauſe they ſo nominate, whether in their very Conſciences they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that by ſuch means as theſe are, any of thoſe ends were ever any whit promoted? or rather, Whether they have not all of them been much retarded and blaſted? This lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I affirm, upon the conſideration of the Curſe of God drawn down upon the frequent abuſes thereby committed, and the apparent ſcandal to more ſober perſons than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the indiſpoſing of ſuch perſons to contribute any noble or worthy act to ſuch purpoſes. I would likewiſe appeal to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, Whether ſuch perſons as theſe, urging theſe acts of Drinking devotion to the King, are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably more devout and fervent by the moſt Divine and effectual means of obtaining his Welfare, Proſperity
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:153333:77"/> and Happineſſe; <hi>viz.</hi> Prayers, private and publick, than other who diſlike and decline this way of uſing Gods Name with ſuch Concomitants. For if they be not, nay (which too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is true) they leſſe concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch moſt proper means tending to the ſafety and honour of the King, than others: What vain pretence of good Affection that way, muſt that needs be, which ſatisfies it ſelf in a zeal for Drinking, as well as wiſhing well to the King, and is chill and rare, and perhaps half aſhamed to be known to be really Religious to that end? Or do they think that God will now adays alſo accept of ſuch a <hi>Libamen,</hi> or Drink-offering, to appeaſe him and oblige him to their wiſhes? This imagination, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together groundleſſe to be ſuppoſed in them, were to ſuppoſe God to be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:153333:77"/> like to men, and them none of the beſt, and to be won to do good by good Liquor. Beſides this, What a grand piece of Honor is it for Kings in a Juſt and Righteous Cauſe, or for Honorable and Virtuous Ladies, to have that character of Honor done to them, which we have found late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done to the bleſſed memory (as they call it) of that Infamous Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Stephen Colledge;</hi> and is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done by the ſame Zealots for Healths, to Queans of lewd Life and Converſation. Yet if you deny this, you become obnoxious, as if ſome notorious affront had been put upon the Propounder and Propounded too.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the judgment of ancient Fathers, and their excellent Wiſdom and Zeal againſt the Sin of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, allianced ſo ſtraitly to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:153333:78"/> Drinking of Healths, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly walk together, oppoſe this cuſtom: as hath been partly ſhewed already, and might be farther made good from other Teſtimonies: but I ſuppoſe thoſe moſt concerned, do not like to hear much of the ſeverity of the ancient Fathers, which will not ſute with our days. But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks they ſhould not ſo eaſily paſſe over or contemn that Royal Law of Feaſting and Drinking, made by that glorious <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> recorded in Holy Scripture: who in his moſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, ample, and ſplendid Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Wines of all ſorts, took great care that none ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, but drink according to his own mind and election; which is wholly voided now adays by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary practices. Yet that moſt Noble, Vertuous and Renowned Emperor,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:153333:78"/> 
                        <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> thought that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample worthy his Imitation, and the vulgar Vice worthy his care to reſtrain and baniſh his Court and Army: For thus we finde it Decreed in his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Conſtitutions, to be found in <hi>Goldaſtus Imperial. Conſtit. Tom. 1. pag. 147. Artic.</hi> 7. concerning Military Diſcipline: <hi>Ne alius alium ad biben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum provocaret, aut cogeret. Ebrium in exercitu de caetero aquam potare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulit. i. e.</hi> 
                        <q>He forbade any to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate or challenge another to drink. Whoever was Drunk in his Army, he compelled to drink Water for the time to come.</q> And the ſame do we finde in <hi>Aventine</hi> his <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Bavaria, lib. 4. pag.</hi> 217. related of that Great Prince; with a more plain expreſſion of his ſingular care to prevent Drunkenneſſe: <hi>Ebrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem inhibuit, neve alius alii propinaret:</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:153333:79"/>
                        <q>He ſo reſtrained Drunkenneſſe, that he would not ſuffer one to drink to another;</q> I ſuppoſe, ſo as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him to pledge him by ſuch obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations as Healths bring along with them. Which would be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now adays as ſuch a violation of the Charter of Free-born and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited Carowzers (as the late word is) that it would go near to hazard a mutiny in the Corporation of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows, as they like to be termed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved and impoſed.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe we hear very ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Accuſations made by the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the Conforming Clergy of this Church, of their liberty in this kinde; which as we no ways whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, we cannot but partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as ſeeing leſſe ſcrupulouſneſſe and exactneſſe in very many of them in their walking, than <hi>Charles the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:153333:79"/> Great</hi> required of his Soldiers (as if the Soldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Leaders, ought not to walk more unblameably, than the ſecular Soldiers) we hold our ſelves bound to put them in mind of ſome ſpecial Canons of the Church; which when this vile Cuſtom of Drinking of Healths crept into the Clergy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt ſuch Scandals: as did the Council of <hi>Laterane</hi> under <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the Third, <hi>chap.</hi> 15. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus <hi>A crapula &amp; ebrietate omnes Clerici diligenter abſtineant, &amp;c.</hi> 
                        <q>Let all Clergy-men carefully avoid Gluttony and Drunkennſs: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them temper their Wine [with Water] and themſelves with Wine.</q> And leſt the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe may ſeem to take place here, which ſays, Drunkenneſſe indeed, and forcing any body to Drink, is no
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:153333:80"/> ways to be allowed, in the Clergy eſpecially; but Drinking an Health or two and away, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; let them hear what follows in the ſame Chapter: <hi>Neither let any man be moved to drink, ſeeing Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe baniſhes the underſtanding and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſtirs up the fuel of luſt: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we Decree that abuſe to be wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, whereby in ſome places, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are wont to oblige themſelves to drink equal draughts: ſo that he, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch, is moſt applauded, who makes moſt Drunk and takes off fulleſt Cups. But if any offend in this kinde, unleſſe upon admoniſhment from his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, he ſhall make competent ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, let him be ſuſpended from his Benefice, and from his Office.</hi> And this ſeaſonable and neceſſary proviſion was made likewiſe by that excellent Prelate <hi>Hermannus,</hi> Elector and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:153333:80"/> of <hi>Colon,</hi> in a Council held there, in the year 1530. tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Reformation, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſperouſly, which is ſtill extant in the twenty fourth Chapter, <hi>De Officio Clericorum,</hi> where the above-quoted words of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> are related a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Drunkenneſſe, and urged eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially againſt the Clergy, in theſe words following: <hi>A crapula itaque &amp; ebrietate, a compotationibus illis ad aequales Calices, a luxu ab alea, &amp;c.</hi> 
                        <q>This Council calleth all of the Clergy from Gormandizing, from Drunkenneſſe, or Drinking-match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by equal Cups, from Luxury.</q> They of the Clergy therefore, who engage in ſuch Bouts, are Offenders againſt their Order, againſt Reaſon, againſt Authority of Doctors and Councils, and become pitiful Sheep themſelves, and cowardly inſtead of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:153333:81"/> being Paſtors, and Leaders of Chriſts Flock, being led away with ſuch a corrupt Cuſtome; are much more culpable and diſorderly than others who do the very ſame thing: unleſſe we except thoſe who will put off, or at leaſt forget their Gown, to put on the Gallant and Gentleman, as they fondly imagine. Is this to be ſober, grave, temperate, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> requires, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters of the Church? Is this to be examples to the Flock, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> enjoyns them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3? Or do we think Phanatically ſo well of our ſelves and Profeſſion, that we can hallow a bad and ſcandalous act by our Perſonal Sanctity, or the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our Profeſſion? and that that preſently becomes lawful, grave and ſober, which we, ſo accounting our ſelves, ſhall do, and by our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:153333:81"/> commend to others?</p>
                     <p>And whereas it is here frequently ſaid by way of vindication, That Exceſſe they condemn as much as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but Healths moderately uſed can give no juſt offence, nor do any harm: hereby intimating and giving out, that they (forſooth) have this mad Dog in a ſtring, and can rule him as they pleaſe. Which if I ſhould, as I do grant is often true, amongſt truly ſtaid and grave Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (eſpecially when the Authour of ſuch and ſuch an Health is Maſter of the Company) yet amongſt equals, if there be but one or two unlucky and ill inclined perſons in the knot, this general limitation ſeldom comes to any thing of due reſtraint: but the prevalency of Cuſtom is ſuch, as Blind men having indeed a Dog on a ſtring, as if they led him, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:153333:82"/> lead by him; ſo theſe Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Regulations, are themſelves blindly and inſenſibly drawn away into Intemperance, by that cunning old Dog of Cuſtom going before them, which they pretended to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern as they pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>6. And from hence I draw my laſt Reaſon againſt Drinking of Healths; and that is, the ſcandalouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſame: which, were the thing more harmleſſe than generally it is, the known and confeſſed miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages and wickedneſſe of more than one ſort, are ſuch, that a ſober man may not well endure the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of evil. And to make good this my Argument, I ſhall not need to engage in the nice Doctrine of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall given, and ſcandal taken. For it ſuffices to condemn inexcuſably all ſuch ſcandall, that it hath no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:153333:82"/> at all but bare connivance to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. It hath no juſtifiable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſuffer it: It hath the wiſeſt and holieſt Votes againſt it: It is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſo many Tragical Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and Impious Effects, which though they always happen not, yet hereby are ſet on foot. Such ſcandall, I ſay, as this, which hath no good at any time in it, but moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great deal of evill, is certainly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and deſervedly taken, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as deſervedly to be altogether laid aſide.</p>
                     <p>But now adays, every Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founder is become a Philoſopher, and makes uſe of his Metaphyſicks to aſſert the innocency of this Cuſtom, at leaſt. For he will tell you, that Healths and Drunkenneſſe are really diſtinct; and thoſe things that are ſo diſtinct, may be ſeparated; and thoſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:153333:83"/> things which may be ſeparated, may be the one without the other. And does not all this prove alſo, that both ought to be done too? If it doth not, in vain is this Argumentation, which is only tolerable when ſome good Autority enjoyns it, beſides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples (which are rather great than good) or ſome benefit at leaſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ariſeth therefrom: But if none of theſe appear but rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, what a cold Reaſon is it for doing it, that 'tis poſſible there may be no ſin in it? But we know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience (though in the nature of ſome actions preciſely taken, there be no ſin) yet Circumſtances make them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evil. And this of Healths hath more than enough ſo to do. But this I may ſay likewiſe, That if Men in ordering their Converſations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the obvious notices of things as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:153333:83"/> repreſented to their Underſtanding by common appearances, and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fly to ſubtilties of diſputing that which they might know better without diſputing, they will or may at leaſt arrive to that fineneſſe of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, as did that <hi>Polonian</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Scholar to <hi>Socinus,</hi> who went beyond his Maſter (as may be ſeen in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi>) and took up this Dogm to maintain, <hi>That there is no ſuch thing as ſin in the World:</hi> His capital Ground for ſuch his monſtrous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, being taken from the unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe all Men naturally have to erre. Of which Evil, <hi>Fauſtus So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> himſelf complains he could not cure him, nor convince him.</p>
                     <p>Will we yet alledge for our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that we are unawares fallen into Company greater and better than our ſelves, and therefore muſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:153333:84"/> comply with them in ſome degree to avoid offence. It will be eaſily anſwered, The beſt way to avoid offence, is to avoid ſuch company, or to depart. Another way to avoid offence (I mean of the greateſt of all, God Almighty) is to forbear modeſtly at leaſt, where boldneſſe doth not become a Man; but yet directly. For if, while thou haſt the true uſe of thy Reaſon, thou canſt not command thy ſelf, but muſt needs yield to Importunity and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, how wilt thou be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, when the flattery of Drink ſhall combine with the importunity of others inſtigating thee, and make thee facile and flexible to greater meaſures, and ſo lyable to greater miſchiefs.</p>
                     <p>But I am not unſenſible of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of an Apologetical Reaſon for
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:153333:84"/> Drinking ſometimes more freely than ordinary, even to hilarity; and that by good warrant, and to good ends, as the alternation of Joy after ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows poſſeſſing Men, and reparation of Spirits waſted or fled by too much labour or dejection of mind. All which I grant to be true, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no ways condemn all Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not only by uſual Meals, but allow ſomewhat for extraordinary Occaſions, anſwerable to Phyſick taken in the Spring and Fall, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or prevent Diſeaſes entring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Body. But what can be more unreaſonable, than for any man under pretence of ſuch uſefulneſſe, to take Phyſick every day, or every week? Or to ſuppoſe, That when a man is alone, he ſhould not need this foreſaid relief of Body or Mind, but only when he meets Companions for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:153333:85"/> his turn: and that all of theſe ſhould at the ſame time fall into ſuch indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of Body or Mind, as to ſtand in need of ſuch Reſtoratives. And beſides, theſe true<note place="margin">

                  </head>
                  <p>NOtwithſtanding (moſt Dear Brethren) I believe, through Chriſts goodneſſe, ye dread the evil of Drunkenneſſe, as the pit of Hell: and that not only you your ſelves will not Drink more than ye ſhould, but neither oblige, nor compel Men to drink more than becomes them: Yet it can ſcarce happen but ſome will be more careleſſe herein, and neglect Sobriety. Let it not turn
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:153333:89"/> to your prejudice, who conſtantly give ſober Entertainment, that it is neceſſary we ſhould reprove ſome that are given to Drink. For ſeeing (Dear Brethren) that Drunkenneſſe is a grievous and hateful ſin to God, it is ſo ſpread over the World by divers thereunto accuſtoming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that now adays, it is ſcarce look'd on as a Sin: but it is come to that, that they ſcoff at ſuch in their Feaſtings, who cannot drink as much as themſelves; ſo that they adjure Men by unfriendly friendſhip, to take off their Cups more largely than then behoves them. But he that compels another to drink more than he is well able, ſhould do him leſſe injury, if he wounded his Body with a Sword, than by ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Soul by Drunkenneſſe. For our Bodies being made of Earth,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:153333:89"/> like as when too much Wet is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into it, and that daily, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into dirt, ſo that ye cannot Till it; in like manner is it with our Fleſh, having drunk too plentifully, it cannot admit of any Spiritual Husbandry, nor produce any Fruits profitable to the Soul. Whereupon, as all men covet ſufficient Rain in their Fields, that they may Till them, and rejoyce in the plenty of Fruit; ſo in the Cloſe of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they ſhould drink in ſo much only as may ſuffice; leſt by Exceſſe, the firm Land of their Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Lake, breeding Worms and Serpents, and Vices rather than the Fruits of good Works. For Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards are juſt like to Lakes; and what is bred in Lakes, your Charity knoweth very well. Whatever is there bred is nothing of Fruit: There
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:153333:90"/> are produced Serpents, Leeches; there are Frogs, and ſeveral ſorts of Vermine, which are more apt to ſcare a man than profit him, as concerning Food. And thoſe very Weeds and Trees as grow in thoſe Swamps, or near unto the ſides of them, are of no uſe at all: ſo that every year they are burnt. Obſerve likewiſe, that whatever ariſes from Drunkenneſſe, is ordained for the Fire. And ſuch are all they (as I have ſaid) who are given to Drink: who draw out their Dinners to the Evening, and the Day-ſtar beholds their Suppers: who when they ſhould be Faſting, cannot ſtand on their Legs: whoſe Senſes are dull, block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and themſelves, as it were, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried alive.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, in their Drunkenneſſe they neither know themſelves nor others;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:153333:90"/> they can neither go nor ſtand; they can neither ſpeak nor do any thing with reaſon: and oftentimes they are not aſhamed to ſwill till they Spew, and drink in meaſures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure: For Cups of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſize are called for. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by a certain Law, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror deſerves applauſe for his fault. From hence ariſe ſtrifes and brawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and then the parts of the Body are wreathed this way and that way, with horrible leapings; and hence it is, that Adulteries and Murders are committed. And as often as they Drink too much, as if they were troubled with the Palſie, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk on their feet, but their filthy ſides are drag'd to the Bed by the hands of others. They have a miſt before their Eyes, a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and pain of the Head, falling
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:153333:91"/> of the Countenance, trembling of all their Limbs, ſtupidity of Minde and Spirit: In ſuch as theſe is fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led what is written, <hi>Who hath woe, who hath wrath, who hath ſtrifes, who hath wounds without cauſe, who hath redneſſe of eyes?</hi> Have not they who ſtay long at the Wine, and they who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire where there is good Drink, and give themſelves over to take up their Cups?</p>
                  <p>But they who are ſuch, endeavor to make this miſerable excuſe; I ſhall diſoblige my Friend, if, as often as I invite him to Dinner, I ſhall not offer him as much Drink as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. But let not him be thy Friend, which would make thee Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who is thine and his own ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. If thou ſhalt make thy ſelf and another Drunk, you ſhall have Man your Friend, and God your
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:153333:91"/> Enemy. Conſider therefore with thy ſelf, if it be reaſonable, that thou ſhouldſt ſeparate thy ſelf from God, whileſt thou uniteſt thy ſelf to a Drunkard. At leaſt, do not thou adjure him; do not thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him, but leave him to himſelf, ſo that he may drink what he pleaſes: And if he hath a minde to fuddle thee, let him periſh alone, but do not thou periſh with him: O the miſery of Mankinde! How many are there, who force Drunkards and deboiſt Men to drink more than they ſhould, and when the Poor beg but one Cup at their Doors, refuſe to give it them? nor conſider, that what they put upon deboiſt Perſons, Chriſt ought to have received, who hath ſaid, <hi>What ye have done to one of the leaſt of mine, ye have done to me.</hi> But ſuch as they, who bury others
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:153333:92"/> in too much Liquor, ſay to the poor Man who asketh an Alms, <hi>Be gone, be gone, and God will give you ſomething:</hi> and indeed, while he proceeds, ſome body beſtows ſomething on him. What is it therefore that he meaneth, when he ſaith, <hi>Go on, and God will give you ſomewhat,</hi> but, Go to him who hath God in him, and God will give you. And ſo by the confeſſion of his own mouth, God is not with him, who moving him, he might give to the poor. I beſeech you, dear Brethren, conſider and obſerve dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that when Beaſts are led to the watering, ſo ſoon as they have ſatisfied their Thirſt, though ye hold them long in the Water, their Thirſt being quenched, they neither will, nor can drink at all. Let Drunken men conſider, whether they be not worſe than Beaſts: For ſeeing Beaſts
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:153333:92"/> will not drink more than is requiſite, they take down twice, yea thrice as much Drink as is expedient for them. And what might ſuffice to ſatisfie them for three or four days reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, they ſtrain hard to conſume in one day, to their grievous Sin, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſpend it out of Malignity or Drunkenneſſe. And it were to be wiſhed, they only waſted the Drink, and not deſtroyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>How great a Sin is Drunkenneſſe, when the King cauſed his chief But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to be hanged for ill will, or Drunkenneſſe? Yet the people of the Jews, of whom it is written: <hi>The people ſat down to eat and to drink, and roſe up to play,</hi> after they had drunk more Wine than they ought, cauſed Idols to be made for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and in honor to their Idols,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:153333:93"/> began to dance, and wring their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by divers skippings.</p>
                  <p>What beſides ſprings from Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, the Holy Spirit witneſſes by <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Wine and women draw away wiſe men from God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſenſible. Herod</hi> alſo, when he was heated with Wine too much, upon the dancing of one Laſs, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to be ſlain. And again <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Look not upon the Wine, when it ſheweth its ſelf in the Glaſſe.</hi> It entereth in flatteringly, but at laſt it will bite as a Serpent, and diffuſe its poiſon as a <hi>Baſilisk: Thine eyes ſhall behold ſtrange women, and thy mouth ſhall ſpeak perverſe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo adviſes us againſt the evil of Drunkenneſſe, ſaying, <hi>Be not drunken with Wine, in which is Exceſſe.</hi> Again and again
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:153333:93"/> we plainly ſhew out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, what miſchiefs there are in Drunkenneſſe: In <hi>Solomon</hi> it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>He that loves wine and oyl, ſhall not be rich.</hi> Again, <hi>Give not wine to Kings,</hi> becauſe nothing is kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate where Drunkenneſſe bears rule, leſt peradventure they drink and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Judgments of God, and change the cauſe of the children of the poor. And he alſo ſaith, <hi>The labourer that is drunken ſhall not become rich.</hi> Again, If you drink Wine moderately, you may be ſober. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Wine was made for chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not for Drunkenneſſe, from the beginning. Wine drunk moderately, exalts the mind and body, and is healthful for body and ſoul. Wine much drunk, is the ſtoutneſſe of Drunkenneſſe, the ſtumbling of the unwiſe; eclipſing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:153333:94"/> virtue and cauſing Wounds. If at any time we advertiſe men hereof, drunken men are angry at us, and mutter. But though there may be who are offended, yet by Gods grace, there will be many who willingly liſtening to good counſel, by Gods bleſſing, will be delivered from that grievous ſin. But they who are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry when they hear men ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Foſter-brother and Friend Drunkenneſſe, let them hear us freely ſpeaking to them: Becauſe whatever Drunkard he may be, who doth not repent of it, he certainly ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh everlaſtingly: Foraſmuch as the Holy Spirit ſpeaking by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. lieth not, <hi>Nor Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards ſhall inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> And therefore Drunkards ſhould do better to be offended with themſelves, than with us; and by Gods help,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:153333:94"/> ſhould quit themſelves from the mire of this Filth, or jakes of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: while time is of repenting, let them haſten by Gods aſſiſtence to riſe, and with all the powers of their mind calling humbly on God, let them ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Take me out of the mire that I ſtick not:</hi> and that, <hi>Let not the flood over-whelm me, nor the deep ſwallow me up, nor the pit ſhut her mouth upon me.</hi> For Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, like the pit of Hell, lets none of them go, whom ſhe hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, unleſſe worthy repentance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves them, and reformation follows upon it, but keeps them ſo faſt, that it ſuffers them not to return from the pit of Hell, ſo dark, to the light of love and ſoberneſſe, but by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt in the firſt place underſtand and know, that men are
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:153333:95"/> not made Drunkards in one day, but when by little and little their cruel Enemies oblige and conſtrain them, rather than their Friends, to add one or two Glaſſes to their uſual Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But when once they have brought a Cuſtom upon themſelves, ſo doth the drought of Drunkenneſſe ſeize on them, that it makes them always thirſty. But he that deſires to free himſelf from this evil, as he, by certain diſtances of days, adding to his Drinking, comes to the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Drunkenneſſe, ſo let him by little and little withdrawing, arrive at the light of Sobriety: who if at once he with-holds from himſelf all that was more than neceſſary, which he took, when he finds himſelf to burn with too great thirſt, with great bitterneſſe will exclaim and ſay, He had rather dye than deny himſelf
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:153333:95"/> the cuſtom of drinking and intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf; and ſees not that it were more tolerable for him to dye according to the Fleſh, than to be killed as to his Soul by Drunkenneſſe. And therefore, as is ſaid, that he may neither ſuffer ſo great drought, and he may be delivered from the great evil he endures, let him by diſtances of days, withdraw ſomewhat of the exceſſe of Drinking, until he ſhall be reduced to a moderate habit of Drinking. He who ſhall thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually withdraw, ſhall be both freed from Drunkenneſſe, and ſhall not ſuffer that intolerable puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>I, my Brethren, while I admoniſh you hereof, acquit my ſelf before God. Whoever ſhall refuſe to hearken to me, and ſhall be given to Drink, and will adjure or force others to drink at his Entertainment, ſhall
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:153333:96"/> both anſwer for himſelf and others, at the Day of Judgment. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, (which is worſe) ſome of the Clergy, who ought to reſtrain this themſelves, compel others alſo to drink more than they ought, let them henceforward begin to correct themſelves and others, ſo that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Judgment of Chriſt, they may neither for their own Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor the Drunkenneſſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, incur puniſhment; but rather correcting themſelves, and rebuking others inceſſantly, they may be able to attain eternal Reward.</p>
                  <p>And this I above all intreat you, by the dreadful Day of Judgment, as often as ye make entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments one for another, that ye reject that filthy Cuſtom, whereby three men are wont to drink in a great meaſure unmeaſurably willing or nil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:153333:96"/> as the poiſon of the Devil, out of your Feaſtings; for that Cuſtome is ſtill a Relick of Pagan Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And whoever admits this in his or others Banquetings, let him not doubt but he Sacrifices to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: by which Drinking, the Soul is not only ſlain, but the Body weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But I truſt, by the mercy of God, that he will vouchſafe ſo to inſpire you, that you ſhould ſo abhor ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and ſhameful evil, that you will in no wiſe ſuffer ſuch a thing to be done, but let that which would be quite loſt in ſuch Drunkenneſſe, be advanced to the comfort of the Poor; our Lord Chriſt ſo bringing it to paſſe. Who with the Father and the Holy Spirit, liveth and reigneth God for evermore.</p>

                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:153333:101"/> to eaſe their Guts ſtuff'd with too much Drink, by vomiting: and like unto broken and ſplit Ships, are themſelves toſſed by the Waves of Drunkenneſſe it ſelf, ſo that they know not where they are; and are altogether unable to ſpeak or hear any thing that ſavours of Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we judge of that, when ſuch miſerable and drunken Fellows being ſoaked in too much Wine, deride and vilifie thoſe who will drink no more than is ſufficient, ſaying to them, <hi>Bluſh and be aſhamed. Why cannot ye drink as much as we?</hi> For they will ſay, they are no men. And behold the unhappineſſe of theſe Drunkards; They call themſelves men who lie in the ſink of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and will not allow ſuch to be men, which ſtand on their legs ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:153333:101"/> and civilly. Are they men who lie groveling; and are not they men who ſtand erect? He that conquers Drunkenneſſe is diſparaged; and he that is conquered by Drunkenneſſe is commended. The ſober man is ſcoffed at, who can govern himſelf and others: the Drunkard is not laughed at, he is not lamented who neither knows himſelf nor others.</p>
                  <p>Drunken men are wont to excuſe themſelves thus, as to ſay, <hi>A Great Perſon conſtrained me to drink too much, and being at the Table with the King, I could do no otherwiſe.</hi> To make good our ſhuflings, theſe things we pretended: and that we will not perform, we ſay, we cannot do. Though it ſhould come to this, that it ſhould be ſaid to thee, <hi>Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drink or dye;</hi> it were better your
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:153333:102"/> Fleſh ſhould dye ſober, than that your Soul ſhould dye by drinking: But that excuſe is falſely oppoſed. For Kings themſelves, and whatever mighty Men elſe there may be, who, by Gods Grace, are Sober, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and Chriſtian, and fearing God with all their heart, ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee reſolved not to yield to them, in not being Drunk out of the fear of God, if by chance they ſhould be offended with thee for the preſent, they will afterward have thee in great admiration, ſaying: How greatly did we treat with him? How did we labour with him by threats and terrours, and we could never move him from his ſoberneſſe? For God, who ſeeth that thou wilt not drink too much for his ſake, will alſo himſelf make thee gracious with them who ſtirred thee up, and ſeem'd
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:153333:102"/> to compel thee to drink too much. Let no man ſay, Moſt dear Brethren, that in theſe times there are no Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; there are Martyrs made every day: for <hi>Martyr</hi> is as much to ſay, as <hi>Witneſſe.</hi> Whoever therefore ſhall bear teſtimony to the Truth, and ſhall judge all cauſes according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Juſtice; whatſoever he ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the Teſtimony of Truth and Righteouſneſſe, all that ſhall the Lord account to him for Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And ſo he that ſhall reſiſt Drunkenneſſe, and by Gods aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhall perſevere, ſo that for that he ſhall endure any Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Lord ſhall aſcribe all to him, even to the glory of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome.</p>
                  <p>But I would fain know, moſt Dear Brethren, when a Maſter hath
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:153333:103"/> divers Servants, if he could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that but one of them ſhould be Drunk. Surely none is ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that he ſhould at any time have deſired this, or would have it ſo: With what face? with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall he be Drunk himſelf, who will not endure one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be Drunk? See, through Gods bleſſing, thou haſt a Servant, and God hath thee for his Servant; in ſuch manner as thou deſireſt that thy Servant ſhould ſerve thee, ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou to ſerve God. Tell me in good earneſt, what equity there is in this, that thou ſhouldeſt have a ſober Servant, and God ſhould have a drunken Servant? as if thou wert ſo deſerving, that a ſober Servant ſhould ſerve thee. Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe things diligently, my Deer Brethren, and marke, that there is
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:153333:103"/> no juſtice in this, that we ſhould do to God, what we would not have done to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Peradventure, thou wilt ſay: How do I that to God, that I would not have done to my ſelf? or, How doth it not pleaſe thee to have a Drunkard to thy Servant, and thou wilt not ſerve God in Sobriety? For therefore, Beloved Brethren, ſo wretchedly do men make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Drunk, becauſe they are of opinion that Drunkenneſſe is a very ſmall, or no ſin: But for ſuch their ignorance, are Prieſts more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give an account at the day of Judgment, if they neglect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare daily to the People committed to them, what, and how great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs ariſe from Drunkenneſſe: So that he, who believes Drunkenneſſe
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:153333:104"/> to be a ſmall Sin, if he doth not mend his life, and become penitent for this Drunkenneſſe, Eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſhall unavoidably torment him, together with Murderers and Adulterers; according to what ye know the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankinde, nor Covetous, nor Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, nor Drunkards, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> See, he joyneth here Drunkards with Fornicators and Idolaters, and Sodomiſts, and Adulterers: And that alſo, <hi>Be not drunk with Wine, in which is exceſſe.</hi> And therefore let every man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and conſider with himſelf, that Drunkenneſſe is a grievous Sin: and ſo doing, Drunkenneſſe ſhall not maſter him.</p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:153333:104"/>
                  <p>For ſeeing Drunkenneſſe ſhall not only torment a Man in the World to come, but alſo Men in this Life are worſted with many Diſeaſes in this preſent Life by Drunkenneſſe, let them at leaſt be afraid of Bodily diſtempers, who have no regard to the Salvation of their Souls: let them be afraid of dimneſs of ſight and darkneſs, the ſwimming of the Head, and trembling of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who are not afraid of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of Hell. And this we ſpeak not only to the Laity, but Clergy alſo; for, what is yet worſe, many of the higher Rank of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who ought with others, to Preach the excellency of Sobriety, not only forbear this, but alſo tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelves and others without ſhame or fear. But whoever are ſuch, let them mourn and confeſs
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:153333:105"/>
[their fault] for if they will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Lives, they shall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for themſelves and others alſo. But what a thing is that, when the Meal being over, and Thirſt ſatisfied; when they neither can nor ought to drink any more, then, as if they were freſh, as if they came in at that inſtant, they begin to drink under ſundry names, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Men living, but Angels, and certain other ancient Saints, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they do them great honour, when they bury themſelves in too great Drinking; not underſtanding this, that none do offer ſo great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Holy Angels, and holy Men, as they who make uſe of their Names to ſlay their Souls with Drunkenneſſe. For there are ſome, who for this reaſon only give order to have ſalt Meats provided them,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:153333:105"/> that by that ſaltneſs, they may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw themſelves with too much Drink. If Heathens who know not God should do this, we are not to wonder at it, and leſs may we grieve, becauſe they have no hope in God, they keep to the old Cuſtom of their Fore-fathers: but wherefore should Chriſtians follow their Intemperances moſt filthy, from whoſe Infidelity Gods mercy hath delivered them, whom God hath brought out of Darkneſs into Light, hath called from Death to Life; and to whom all the Scriptures cry, That they should flie Drunkenneſſe, and love Soberneſſe? Wherefore I intreat you, by the dreadful Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and adjure you, That ye avoid Drunkenneſſe as much as ye can poſſible, by Gods help. And
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:153333:106"/> now begin to blush, that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you have complyed with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and Gentiles in the foul Sin of Drunkenneſſe. For becauſe ye are unlike them in Faith, you ought not to be like them at all in Drunkenneſſe. For ſuppoſing Chriſtians ſhould not commit the like Sins with them, Drunkenneſſe alone frequented, where amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and repentance do not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, tumbles them into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Hell, as before we have ſaid: <hi>Nor Drunkards, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome man may ſay, I am not for the Kingdom of God, I only deſire everlaſting reſt. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, let no Man deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; there are two places, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:153333:106"/> there is no third for any body. Whoever ſhall deſerve not to raign with Chriſt, ſhall undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly periſh with the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Whoever he be who Drinks too much to his Friend, becomes his Enemy as to his Soul, and is convicted of weakening his Body, and deſtroying his Soul. It were better that in ſtead of what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him in too great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in one day, and compelled him to drink, he ſhould two or three days invite him to an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment: and wherein he worſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with too much Drinking in one day, he should refresh him other days with competent Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo he should neither looſe his Drink nor deſtroy his Friend.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:153333:107"/> Or, which truly is much better, whatever hath been loſt by too much Drink in the Throat, should be converted into Almes to the Poor: ſo that their Bodies might be reaſonably refreshed with Drink; and by pittying of the Poor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Soul may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. And this correction have we ſpoken of, not for their ſakes who are ſober and civil; for that, through God, we know many that make frugall and ſober Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And therefore for you, who out of the love of God, take on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which is expedient, and what is quite loſt on Earth to Drunkards, is reſerved, through good Deeds a reward in Heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:153333:107"/>
                  <p>Let it not ſuffice that ye your ſelves are ſober, but as much as in you lies, ſo rebuke and reprove Drunkards, that they may never be ſuffer'd in your preſence, to drink more than becomes them: ſo that whiles ye your ſelves love Sobriety, and reclaim others from the deſtruction of Drunkenneſſe, by your counſel, ye may prepare a double reward in Eternall Bliſs, not only for your own Salvation, but the Salvation of others alſo. And my dear Brethren, how much is that to be lamented and blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, that is reported of ſome Country people, who when they have got Wine, or have made ſome other Drink for themſelves, they invite, as to a Wedding-Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, their Neighbours and neareſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:153333:108"/> Friends to Drink; that they may keep them Drinking for three or four Days, and bury them in too much Drink, ſo that all that while they return not from that lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Drinking-bout to their own homes, until all the Drink provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded be ſpent; and which ſufficed to nourish them and their Families for two or three Months, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in four or two Days, by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and shamefull carou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, moſt dear Brethren, while I with great love, as my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall care requires, admonish you in this ſort, I diſcharge my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God. But whoever hears readily and faithfully what I thus Preach to him, shall receive
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:153333:108"/> an Eternal Reward. But he that shall ſlight this, let him fear leſt he ſuffer Eternal and Endleſſe Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But we truſt, that through Gods goodneſſe, all Drunkards will ſo return to Sobriety from the Sin of Drunkenneſſe, by Gods grace, that they will cauſe us to rejoyce, and themſelves may deſerve happily to attain Everlaſting Reward.</p>
                  <closer>Amen.</closer>
